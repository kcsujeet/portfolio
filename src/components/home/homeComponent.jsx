                    <p>Hello! I'm Sujeet, a software engineer based in Kathmandu, Nepal. <br/><br/>
                        I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.<br/><br/>
                        I graduated from Tribhuvan University, IOE, Pulchowk Campus in 2018.  My interests are in experimenting with different software design patterns, cryptography, data security, and software performance. If thereâ€™s any spare time, I enjoy riding motorbike, music, movies and non-fictional books. <br/><br/>
                        Beside programming, I like to explore the ideas and fields of Space Science, Physics, Rocket Science and tech gadgets. Being a huge fan of SpaceX and Tesla, my inspiration and role model is Elon Musk.
